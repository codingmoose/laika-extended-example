This is an example showing how to extend Laika to use **fixtures** and **Collections** in the same way you would use the Meteor API.
It also allows you to use `should.js` and `underscore.js` inside your tests.
You must have them both globally installed:

```js
$ sudo npm install -g should underscore
$ laika
```
